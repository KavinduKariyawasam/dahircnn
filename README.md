# Building Damage Assessment using Dahitra-RCNN

## Overview

In March 2023, **Cyclone Freddy** caused severe flooding in **Blantyre, Malawi**, devastating communities such as **Chilobwe on Soche Mountain**. The disaster was exacerbated by **inadequate drainage, deforestation, and unregulated urban sprawl**, disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups, including **women, pregnant women, and young girls**.

This project aims to **identify houses** and **assess their damage levels** using satellite imagery. We developed a **Dahitra-RCNN-based model**, trained on the **xBD dataset**, and tested on a curated dataset by the **Kuyesera AI Lab**.

## Dataset

The solution leverages data from:

- **xBD Dataset** (pre-trained disaster damage assessment dataset)
- **Kuyesera AI Lab's hand-labeled dataset** (used for evaluation)
- **Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI)** (providing access to large-scale satellite imagery)

### Damage Categories

Each house is classified into one of the following categories:

1. **Destroyed**
2. **Major Damage**
3. **Minor Damage**
4. **No Damage**

## Model: Dahitra-RCNN

We developed a custom **Dahitra-RCNN** (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) for damage assessment. The model:

- **Detects house locations** in satellite images.
- **Classifies** each house into one of the four damage categories.
- Uses a **6-month time gap** between pre- and post-disaster imagery for accurate assessment.
- Employs **AWS cloud resources** for training and inference.

## Results

Below is an example of model performance on test images:

## Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KavinduKariyawasam/dahircnn.git
cd dahircnn
```

### 2. Train the model

```sh
python train.py
```
